        <div class="about">
            <p>Hi, I'm Cyril—but you can call me Cy! My journey into programming began when I chose Information Technology as my course. After my first year, I shifted to Computer Science to dive deeper into the world of coding.</p>
            <p>I've always had a passion for coding and problem-solving, and it feels great to see my ideas come to life through code. Over time, I've learned several programming languages and technologies, including Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I’m constantly looking to grow and expand my knowledge in this ever-evolving field, and I’m excited to continue my journey as a computer science student!</p>
